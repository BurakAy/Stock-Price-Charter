## About
Stock Price Charter will create a stacked line chart displaying the yearly performance of a stock.<br>
A line is added to the chart for each file uploaded.
- Files must be CSV.
- Each file should include one year's worth of data for a stock.
- Include the year in each file name as the file name is used in the legend.
- Enter the column name of the data you would like to chart (only supporting one column name at this time).

After clicking 'OK' to confirm, a stacked line chart will be generated and displayed.<br>
A PNG of the chart will also be created and saved in the directory.
